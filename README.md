# 1984 Book vs 1984 Album NLP Comparison

Inspired by the cultural phenomenon, Versus, we will leverage NLP techniques to compare two iconic works: 1984, the dystopian social science fiction novel by English novelist George Orwell, and 1984, the sixth studio album by American rock band Van Halen.

## Overview

We have performed the following:

1. **Summarizing Text**: Generate summaries of the book and album, extracting key points and themes.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment expressed in both the book and album, exploring the emotional tone conveyed.
3. **Word Clouds**: Create word clouds to visually represent the most frequently occurring words in the text, providing insights into the primary topics and concepts.


## Project Structure

- **data**: This directory contains the raw text data of both the book and the album lyrics.
- **1984 versus NLP**: This a jupyter notebook which performs the above tasks.
